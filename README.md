# CSE464FinalProject
This is the final project for CSE 464 Introduction to Algorithms.  
This project uses a graph datastructure, made from an adjacency list, and finds the shortest paths in a given route by the user. 
It will only find the shortest path from the start point noted by the user, and the end point noted by the user.
